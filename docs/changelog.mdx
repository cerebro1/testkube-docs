# Testkube Changelog

## v1.15.0 (2025-05-23)

This release is available in Helm Chart v2.321.0.

## What changed?

Quality has been our focus for Testkube v1.15.
This release is packed with a variety of bug fixes and improvements.

Our team also took a good look at the release procedures of the Testkube Control Plane:

- Changelogs! Testkube's control plane now comes with public changelogs and a unified version.
In the past, each service such as the dashboard, API Server, workers, etc, would have its own version.
Today they all share the same version which makes it easier to communicate changes and service interoperability.
- The release cadence will also be reduced to better fit enterprises. Moving forward you can expect a monthly minor release with some unplanned patch versions in between. The new process also improves predictability and stability of these releases.
- Our Helm Chart is now available as an OCI Artifact. The old Helm Repository approach still works, but under the hood it will now also pull as an OCI Artifact.
