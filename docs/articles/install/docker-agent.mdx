# Testkube Docker Agent

The Testkube Docker Agent provides a convenient way to evaluate Testkube Cloud and can be run directly under
Docker without having to install or manage your own Kubernetes distribution.

:::info
The Testkube Docker Agent is not recommended for production usage - [Read More](#not-for-production-usage)
:::

## Resource Allocation

While the Testkube Agent itself does not consume a lot of resources, you should make sure you have allocated the
right amount of resources to your Docker Engine for the kinds of Tests you plan to run. We recommend to allocate at least
8GB and 2 CPUs for "simple" test executions (Postman, K6, etc.), and at least 16 GB and 4 CPUs for more
high-volume/distributed performance tests and E2E tests using Playwright, Cypress or Selenium
since these require a fair amount of resources themselves.

:::tip
If you prefer to use your own local Kubernetes cluster for the Testkube Agent, have a look at
[Testkube Agent with local Kubernetes](/articles/install/quickstart-no-k8s).
:::

## Installation

Install the Testkube Agent using `docker run` with arguments provided in the Testkube Dashboard:

```shell
docker run --name=docker-testkube-agent --privileged -e AGENT_KEY=tkcagnt_XXX -e CLOUD_URL=agent.testkube.io:443 kubeshop/testkube-agent
```

(Starting the Agent the first time can take a couple of minutes)

:::note
The `--privileged` flag is required for the Agent Docker Image to provision its own Kubernetes runtime environment.
:::

Once running, the Agent will connect to the Testkube Control Plane and be available for running your Workflows.

### Checking Agent Status

You can use `docker ps` to check the Agents Docker status:

```shell
➜  ~ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS           NAMES
5c9f8f1eae58   kubeshop/testkube-agent   "tini -- /usr/local/…"   6 minutes ago   Up 6 minutes   2375-2376/tcp   docker-testkube-agent
➜  ~
```

### Accessing the terminal inside the Docker Agent

If you want to run `kubectl` (or any other) commands inside the Docker Agent you can use

```shell
docker exec -it <name> sh
```

for creating a corresponding prompt inside your Docker Agent.

### Starting and stopping the Agent

Use regular docker commands to stop and start the agent:

```shell
docker stop <name>
docker start <name>
```

## Docker Agent internals

The Testkube Docker Agent provisions its own [Kind cluster](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) inside Docker and then uses an
[entrypoint.sh script](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube/blob/main/build/kind/entrypoint.sh) to set up its environment and install the Agent using Helm.

The Docker Image itself is available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kubeshop/testkube-agent).

### Pod errors due to "too many open files"

If you encounter this error inside your Docker Agent you will need to increase the corresponding default settings
in your environment - [Read More](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/known-issues/#pod-errors-due-to-too-many-open-files).

## Not for Production Usage!

:::info
Although the Testkuber Docker Agent is a great way to run Testkube tests in your infrastructure, it is **not** meant
for production or large-scale deployments as it is (very) constrained by the Docker runtime environment itself.

When deploying the Testkube Agent production or advanced evaluation purposes, please run the agent directly under a
Kubernetes instance, either locally or in a remote/hosted Kubernetes provider in line with the
[Installation Overview](/articles/install/overview).
