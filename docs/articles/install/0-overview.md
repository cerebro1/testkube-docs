# About Installing Testkube

:::info
**Testkube** has flexibility in its deployments.
The Testkube agents are test runners and always run within your cluster.
Whether the control plane is self-hosted, managed by Testkube Cloud, or not used is up to you. When in doubt, we recommend to check out [our reference architectures][testkube-architectures] to learn more.
:::

You can install Testkube by using one of the following deployment options:

- Use [the Testkube CLI][testkube-cli] for an out-of-the-box experience.
- Use [the Testkube Helm Chart][testkube-helm] to further customize deployment.
