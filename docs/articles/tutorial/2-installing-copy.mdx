# Installing #2

Testkube has flexible deployments to facilitate to your needs. Our agents are test runners which are always managed by you. Our control plane can be self-hosted or managed by Testkube Cloud.

You can choose to run Testkube by using one of the following deployment options:

- Use [On-Prem][testkube-on-prem] to TODO.
- Use [Cloud][testkube-cloud] to TODO.
- Try [Cloud's demo environment][testkube-helm] in case you are short on time and just want a brief look at what we have to offer.
