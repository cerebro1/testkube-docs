## Next steps

You've seen your first test workflow and integrated it within your pipeline.
That's only scratching the surface of what Testkube has to offer.
You can dive deeper in topics such as [defining workflow][upnext-workflows], [managing executions][upnext-executions] or simply get your hands dirty by giving [our examples][upnext-examples] a shot.
