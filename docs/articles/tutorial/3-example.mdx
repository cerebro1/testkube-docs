# Testing a sample application

In this getting started tutorial you will learn how to run tests on a sample application that resembles a real-life three-tier architecture.

You can find the application on GitHub in [this repository][sample-repo].
It consists of a small React web app with a NodeJS backend and PostgreSQL database.
The technologies and testing tools are a detail as the goal is to go over workflow features that you will likely run into while getting started yourself.

## Objectives

- Learn how to run unit, black-box and end-to-end tests using TestWorkflows.

## Run black-box tests for the API

TODO explanation etcâ€¦

```yaml
apiVersion: testworkflows.testkube.io/v1
kind: TestWorkflow
metadata:
  name: test-api-blackbox
  namespace: testkube
spec:
  content:
    git:
      uri: https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube-samples
      revision: main
      paths: ["api"]
  container:
    image: node:alpine
    workingDir: /data/repo/api
  steps:
    - name: Install dependencies
      shell: npm install --ci
