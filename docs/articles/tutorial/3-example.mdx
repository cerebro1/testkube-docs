# Testing a sample application

In this getting started tutorial you will learn how to run tests on a sample application that resembles a real-life three-tier architecture.

You can find the source code of the application here.
It consists of a small React web app with a NodeJS backend and PostgreSQL database.
These technologies and testing tools are a detail as the goal is to go over workflow features that you will likely run into while getting started yourself.

## Objectives

- Learn to use TestWorkflows with services.

## Run unit tests for the API

## Run black-box tests for the API

## Run E2E tests with Cypress
