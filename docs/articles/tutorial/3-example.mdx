# Testing a sample application

In this getting started tutorial you will learn how to run tests on a sample application that resembles a real-life three-tier architecture.

You can find the application on GitHub in [this repository][sample-repo].
The technologies and testing tools are a detail as the goal is to go over workflow features that you will likely run into while getting started yourself.
It consists of a small React web app with a NodeJS backend and PostgreSQL database.

## Objectives

- Learn how to run unit, black-box and end-to-end tests using TestWorkflows.
- Learn about TestWorkflow configuration, sharding and services.
- Learn

## Running blackbox tests

To run our blackbox tests, we are going to git clone, install dependencies and run our testing tool.
You can use [TestWorkflow configuration][tw-config] to set the git ref dynamically and run the workflow for any given commit.

```yaml
apiVersion: testworkflows.testkube.io/v1
kind: TestWorkflow
metadata:
  name: test-api-blackbox
  namespace: testkube
spec:
  # Defines parameters that can be used within your workflows
  # You can interpolate the variable with an expression: {{ config.your_variable }}.
  config:
    ref:
      type: string
      default: "main"
  content:
    git:
      uri: https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube-samples
      # The revision is the branch, tag or commit sha of your git repository.
      # in this case, it's a configuration variable that defaults to the 'main' branch.
      revision: "{{ config.ref }}"
      # (optionally) You can limit fetching specific paths to increase cloning performance.
      paths: ["api"]
  container:
    # The default image for your steps. You can choose to override the image within each step.
    image: node:alpine
    # The default working directory for your steps. Git content will be checked out in `/data/repo`.
    workingDir: /data/repo/api
  steps:
    # The `shell` keyword is a shorthand over `run` which makes it convenient to execute commands
    # In this case we first install all dependencies and afterwards run the tests.
    # Each of these steps runs in its own container while sharing the file system.
    - name: Install dependencies
      shell: npm ci
    - name: Run test
      shell: npm run test
```

You would afterwards call this in your continuous integration with the `--config` flag as seen below:

```sh
testkube run testworkflow test-api-blackbox --config ref=${CI_COMMIT_SHA} --watch
```

## Running tests on a private git repository

When running your own test workflows, you likely use a private git repository.
You can use `config` to authenticate. While it will depend a bit on the git provider,
it will likely look similar to this example with Github fine-grained access tokens:

```diff
apiVersion: testworkflows.testkube.io/v1
kind: TestWorkflow
metadata: ...
spec:
+  config:
+    accessToken:
+      type: string
  content:
    git:
-      uri: https://github.com/your-org/public-repo.git
+      uri: https://oauth2:{{ config.accessToken }}@github.com/your-org/private-repo.git
```

## Run E2E tests

There are various ways to run your end-to-end tests. In this example we will rely on an externally created preview environments.

<Tabs groupId="tutorial-example-e2e">
<TabItem value="external-preview" label="With external previews">

```yaml
kind: TestWorkflow
apiVersion: testworkflows.testkube.io/v1
metadata:
  name: test-e2e
  namespace: testkube
spec:
  config:
    # Define the base URL on which the application under test will be available
    baseUrl:
      type: string
  content:
    git:
      uri: https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube-samples
      revision: main
      paths: ["app"]
  container:
    workingDir: /data/repo/app
    # You have full control over the resource requests and limits. In this case,
    # let's increase Cypress requests as it's quite a big tool to run.
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 2Gi
  steps:
    - name: Run e2e tests
      container:
        image: cypress/included:13.10.0
        env:
          - name: CYPRESS_baseUrl
            value: "{{ config.baseUrl }}"
      shell: cypress run
```
