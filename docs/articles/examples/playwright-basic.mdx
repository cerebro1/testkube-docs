# Basic Playwright Framework Example

Below is a basic workflow for executing a Playwright project which is available
on GitHub. You can paste this directly into the YAML of an existing or new test, just make
sure to update the `name` and `namespace` for your environment if needed.

- The `spec.content` property defines the location of the GitHub project
- The `spec.steps` property defines a single step that runs the test and uploads the created reports, including
  the generated trace report.

After execution, you can see the output from the test executions under the executions panel tabs:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="logs" label="Log Output" default>

The log output from the Playwright Framework execution:

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="artifacts" label="Artifacts" default>

The uploaded report is available in the Artifacts tab:

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="html-overview-report" label="Overview Report" default>

Clicking the HTML report opens it in your browser:

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="html-test-report" label="Test Report" default>

Clicking a specific test shows that tests details, including a link to the trace report.
