# Playwright - Rerun Failed Tests

Playwright provides the ability to only rerun failed tests from a previous execution, which can come in handy
to cut down overall execution times when working with flaky tests and/or when you know the reason for a specific test failure
has been fixed and rerunning all tests is not necessary - [Read More](https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests#run-last-failed-tests).
(Not to be confused this with Playwrights' ability to automatically retry failed tests - [Read more](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-retries).)

## Workflow Overview

The below Workflow shows how to leverage this functionality in Testkube alongside "regular" Playwright test execution, with a couple of caveats:

- Playwright needs previous execution results to rerun failed tests, the below Workflow retrieves these by automating
  the Testkube CLI `testkube download artifact` command to download the corresponding `test-results/.last-run.json` file from a previous execution.
  - The "Get last execution results" step (lines 31-49) uses `testkube get testworkflowexecution` to get the execution before the ongoing one
    and then a combination of `grep` and `sed` to extract the `executionId`.
  - The "Get specific execution results" step (lines 50-64) uses the provided `executionId` instead.
- The CLI needs an API Token to retrieve results; it is recommended to use a `Member` token with access to the
  containing Environment with Read permissions as described at [Member Tokens](/testkube-pro/articles/api-token-management#member-tokens)
  and replace the `tkcapi_XXXX` value on line 57
- The Workflow prompts for three parameters (all optional):
  - `rerunFailed` : tells the Workflow to rerun failed executions from a previous execution; if set to `false` (default)
     the Workflow will just run your Playwright tests normally (see line 75)
  - `executionId` : which previous execution to rerun; if not specified the Workflow will use the previous execution when `rerunFailed` is set to `true`.
  - `failOnMissing` : fails the Workflow if the previous/specified execution has no results when `rerunFailed` is set to true (defaults to `false`).
- The "Get xx execution results" steps are marked as `optional` so they don't fail the Workflow if no corresponding execution or artifact is found,
  this is done by the "Fail if no previous results are Found" step instead if the `failOnMissing` property is set to `true`.

## Workflow Execution

### Running tests normally 

When initially/normally running this Workflow, we'll not provide any input, which results in our Playwright tests executing normally:

![Running Tests Normally](images/rerun-run-tests-normally.png)

As you can see in the execution popup, the steps related to rerunning were skipped:

![Normal Execution](images/rerun-normal-execution.png)

### Rerunning failed tests

Now let's rerun our test with the `rerunFailed` parameter set to true:

![Rerun Failed Tests Config](images/rerun-with-rerun.png)

The execution now runs the corresponding steps, and we can see the downloading of the previous results artifact in the log:

![Rerun Failed Tests Execution](images/rerun-rerun-execution.png)

Since we didn't have any failing tests in our previous execution, this new execution didn't run any tests at all, which you
can see in the generated report:
