# Basic Chainsaw Example
[Chainsaw](https://github.com/kyverno/chainsaw.git) is an open-source tool initially developed to define and run Kyverno end-to-end tests. It can test any Kubernetes objects.

Below is a simple workflow for executing a Chainsaw test available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cerebro1/chainsaw-testkube-demo.git). You can paste this directly into the
YAML of an existing or new test, just make sure to update the `name` and `namespace` for your environment as needed.

- The `spec.content` property defines the path to the Chainsaw test in a GitHub repository.
- The `spec.container` property uses the official Chainsaw image to set up test environment.
- The `spec.steps` property defines a single step that runs the `chainsaw test <test path>` test command which generates a 
  JUnit-style XML Report which Testkube can visualise accordingly ([Read More](/articles/test-workflows-reports))

After execution, you can see the log output from the Chainsaw execution under the "Log Output" panel:

If your test produced a JUnit report it is available under the JUnit Report tab accordingly.

## Using a custom ServiceAccount

Chainsaw tests attempt to create a temporary namespace to which they deploy resources to be asserted. The default 
ServiceAccount used by Testkube to run Workflows does not have permissions to create/get/delete namespaces, requiring
you to define a corresponding ServiceAccount and use that in your Chainsaw Workflow (as shown on lines 12-13 in the example above).

Use kubectl to apply the following configuration to the cluster where the Testkube Agent is running. 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: chainsaw-service-account
  namespace: testkube
---
# Example Cluster Role for Chainsaw Tests
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: chainsaw-service-account-cr
rules:
  - verbs:
      - create
      - delete
      - get
    apiGroups:
      - ''
    resources:
      - namespaces
---
# Bind SA to the ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: chainsaw-service-account-crb
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: chainsaw-service-account-cr
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: chainsaw-service-account
    namespace: testkube
```
