# Legacy Documentation

The following functionality is being deprecated in Testkube in favor of [Test Workflows](test-workflows) and [Workflow Templates](test-workflow-templates), as 
these provide a much more powerful and flexible solution for defining how to run tests with Testkube.

- Tests
- Test Suites
- Executors
- Sources
- Templates

The documentation for these will be available under this Legacy section for the time being, including old examples, tutorials, etc.
