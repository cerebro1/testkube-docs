# Using Testkube with ArgoCD

This document will describe different ways you can use Testkube with ArgoCD, as a prerequisite you should have good understanding
of both Testkube, ArgoCD and GitOps principles. For a more high-level introduction and step-by-step tutorial, please check out

## Managing Testkube CRDs with ArgoCD

Testkube stores its core resources (Workflows, Triggers, etc.) as Custom Resources in your Kubernetes Cluster -
[Read More about Testkube CRDs](/articles/crds), which makes it straight forward to manage them using a GitOps tool
like ArgoCD.

When creating an Argo Application for a repo that contains Workflows, there are a couple of things to keep in mind:

- The target namespace has to have the Testkube Agent installed if you want to be able to use the synced resources accordingly
  (the Testkube Agent can currently only work with Testkube resource in its own namespace).
- Since the target namespace has the Agent installed, it is important to NOT select the Prune option when syncing your
  Application with Argo, otherwise Argo will remove the Agent from your namespace - unless you
