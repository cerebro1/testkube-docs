# Testkube Open Source 

The Testkube Agent is 100% Open Source and can be [deployed in standalone mode](install/standalone-agent) without being managed
by the commercial Control Plane.

Once deployed, you can interact with the agent through the [Testkube CLI](install/cli) or directly via the
[Agent API](/openapi/overview#agent-api).

## Getting Started with Open Source

- Start by [Installing the Standalone Agent](/articles/install/standalone-agent#installing-the-standalone-agent)
- Use the Testkube CLI to create your first Workflow 

## Migrating from OSS to Commercial

Migrating from a Standalone Agent deployment to utilizing the Testkube Control plane is described 
at [Connecting to the Testkube Control Plane](/articles/install/standalone-agent#connecting-to-the-testkube-control-plane).

## Source Code and Licensing

The source-code for the agent is available in the [Testkube GitHub repo](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube)
and is dual-licensed under the MIT license and the Testkube Community License (TCL).
